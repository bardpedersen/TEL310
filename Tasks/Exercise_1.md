## Exercise 1 
### a)
The minimal number of steering command to guide the wheeled robot from its initial position (1.0, 2.0) m with heading angle θ = π rad to the desired position (1.5, 2.0) m with heading angle θd = π/2 rad is two.
One that drives the robot backwards from [1, 2] to [1.5, 2], and one that turns it 90 degrees to the right.

### b)
Under this constraint the shortes trajectory is 0.5m.

### c)
