### sample_model_velocity:
![sample_model_velocity](Assignment1/images/sample_model_velocity.png)

Here the blue dots are the different samples, the red dots are the start and the end position.
Start position:
test_xt_1 = [0, 0, 0]
End position:
test_xt = [1.8, 0.75, math.pi/4]
Parameters of the motion noise:
alpha = [0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001]
